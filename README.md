# Programming in Lua (4th Edition) Exercises


## Description

More than anything else: proof that I read programming books.

Unfiltered, honest attempts at programming exercises detailing
my thought processes and ways of solving problems.

If your an employer, this is probably of particular relevance
to you. Enjoy! :)

P.S: I'm only going to post what I've done for exercises which
involve problem solving and code.
Personally, I don't think that questions of memory and preference
are particularly fun or useful to read!


## Usage

```
lua src/filename.lua
```
